# Foundations-Landing-Page

This is a simple project about flexbox, I'll try to solve a beginner challenge proposed by The Odin Project (www.theodinproject.com).

I expect to practice some fundamental concepts and reinforce good commit practices, therefore improve my overall skills and knowledge about css and html.
